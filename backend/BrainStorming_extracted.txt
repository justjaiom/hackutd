NVIDIA
 
Track:
 
Built
 
using
 
NVIDIA
 
NeMo
 
for
 
agentic
 
AI
 
orchestration
 
and
 
reasoning.
 
 
3.
 
Startup
 
Track:
 
Focused
 
on
 
developing
 
a
 
scalable
 
SaaS
 
startup
 
platform.
 
 
 
Overview:
 
Adjacent
 
is
 
an
 
intelligent
 
project
 
management
 
platform
 
powered
 
by
 
a
 
network
 
of
 
autonomous
 
AI
 
agents
 
that
 
collaborate
 
to
 
automatically
 
generate,
 
organize,
 
and
 
maintain
 
a
 
Jira-style
 
project
 
board
.
 
The
 
system
 
transforms
 
raw
 
project
 
data—such
 
as
 
text,
 
meeting
 
notes,
 
videos,
 
and
 
uploaded
 
files—into
 
structured,
 
actionable
 
plans.
 
 
How
 
It
 
Works:
 
1.
 
Data
 
Ingestion:
 
 
Users
 
upload
 
or
 
connect
 
various
 
project
 
inputs,
 
including
 
meeting
 
recordings/notes,
 
transcripts,
 
or
 
documents.
 
 
2.
 
Lead
 
Agent:
 
 
A
 
“Lead
 
Agent”
 
processes
 
this
 
data
 
to
 
gain
 
full
 
project
 
context
 
and
 
understanding.
 
It
 
identifies
 
goals,
 
key
 
milestones,
 
and
 
dependencies.
 
Then
 
identifies
 
“
tensions
”
 
within
 
the
 
whole
 
project.
 
 
 
3.
 
Task
 
Assignment:
 
 
The
 
lead
 
agent
 
spawns
 
specialized
 
sub-agents
 
(e.g.,
 
design,
 
engineering,
 
marketing,
 
and
 
planning
 
agents).
 
Each
 
sub-agent
 
analyzes
 
a
 
specific
 
domain
 
and
 
collaborates
 
to
 
draft
 
detailed
 
deliverables.
 
The
 
deliverables
 
and
 
company
 
profile
 
(information
 
such
 
as
 
codebases/files,
 
description,
 
etc.)
 
are
 
compiled,
 
and
 
specific
 
live
 
“
tensions
”
 
within
 
the
 
company
 
are
 
identified
 
and
 
created
 
 

4.
 
Output
 
Generation:
 
 
The
 
agents
 
collectively
 
build
 
a
 
dynamic
 
Jira
 
board
 
within
 
our
 
platform,
 
organizing:
 
 
○
 
Task
 
cards
 
with
 
detailed
 
descriptions
 
and
 
dependencies
 
 
○
 
AI-generated
 
priorities
 
and
 
deadlines
 
 
○
 
Status
 
labels
 
(To-Do,
 
In
 
Progress,
 
Review,
 
Done)
 
 
5.
 
User
 
Interaction:
 
 
A
 
built-in
 
chatbot
 
interface
 
allows
 
users
 
to
 
ask
 
questions
 
about
 
tasks,
 
priorities,
 
or
 
timelines,
 
and
 
make
 
live
 
edits.
 
Any
 
changes
 
are
 
instantly
 
synchronized
 
across
 
the
 
AI-generated
 
board.
 
 
 
Final
 
Output:
 
●
 
A
 
fully
 
populated
 
Jira-style
 
board
 
with
 
clear
 
task
 
breakdowns,
 
assigned
 
responsibilities,
 
and
 
AI-determined
 
priorities.
 
 
 
●
 
Lifecycle
 
tracking
 
of
 
the
 
product
 
from
 
ideation
 
to
 
delivery.
 
 
●
 
An
 
interactive
 
chat
 
assistant
 
for
 
continuous
 
project
 
updates
 
and
 
clarifications.
 
 
 
Vision:
 
AgentFlow
 
aims
 
to
 
redefine
 
team
 
productivity
 
by
 
combining
 
agentic
 
AI
 
collaboration
 
and
 
automated
 
project
 
structuring
,
 
eliminating
 
the
 
manual
 
overhead
 
of
 
planning
 
and
 
allowing
 
teams
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
execution
 
and
 
innovation.
 
 
The
 
halo
 
product
,
 
or
 
the
 
second
 
part,
 
is
 
a
 
live
 
agent
 
who
 
compiles
 
all
 
the
 
information
 
and
 
identifies
 
“Tensions”
 
within
 
the
 
company/project.
 
A
 
tension
 
would
 
be
 
organic
 
work
 
that
 
emerges
 
when
 
a
 
gap
 
between
 
what
 
is
 
and
 
what
 
should
 
be
 
is
 
detected.
 
New
 
projects
 
are
 
born
 
from
 
newly
 
created
 
or
 
resolved
 
tensions
 
and
 
additions.
