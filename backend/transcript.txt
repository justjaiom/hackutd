 Okay, my name is Jordan. I'm the front end developer on the team. This week I'm going to be working on a few different components. So I'm going to be working on the landing page. I'm going to develop the hero section. I am going to work on authentication and then I'm going to work on the handband board side of the software. The teammate number two will work on the back end implementing Nvidia's neemotronic agent to AI. TMA three is going to be working on onboarding and TMA four is also working on front end. I'm talking on a Google me.
